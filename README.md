## Objectives
This will test your knowledge of API creation, REST semantics, SQL, security, and working in a regulated environment â€” and most of all, your communication skills and ability to work with other engineers.

The main mission, should you choose to accept, is to get all the tests passing! However not all issues are tied to tests so be on the lookout.
As you interact with the code, feel free to call out any potential bugs or security issues. We will hint at areas that need refactoring or further discussion.

Notes:
1. Remember that this app isn't perfect or production-ready. Focus on fixing the tests and debugging the app in it's current state.
2. Focus on the `customers` package that contains the controller, service, repository, and `Customer` model.
3. Don't update the test files (any file ending in `_test.go`).
4. Ask questions! We are here to help. Treat this as if you're leading a pair-programming session.

## Getting Started

You will need to have `docker` or a `Go` development environment setup to run the tests.

### Test Coverage

Tests are all confirmed to be working before strategic errors were created.

### Running

The tests can be run in any of the following ways
- If you have Go installed, use `make test` to run
    ```
    go test -cover ./...
    ```
- If you have Docker installed, use `make docker-test` to run
    ```
    docker build -f Dockerfile.tester .
    ```
